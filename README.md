Make sure that you have a Userscript Engine installed.  
I use the [Violentmonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) extension for Chrome on desktop and the [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/xk/app/userscripts/id1463298887) app for Safari on iOS.  
Then all you have to do is click the link below to install!  

<kbd> <br> [Install Userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oshanotter/Pixlr-Zoom-Scroll-Fixer/main/Pixlr-Zoom-Scroll-Fixer.user.js) <br> </kbd>

If you have any trouble installing the scripts, refer to the respective Userscript Engine's help page.

## Usage

Using the script is simple! After it is installed, just forget about it and your Userscript Engine will do the rest!
Updates happen automatically, but if you encounter an issue, [report a new issue](../../issues) under this repository, if it hasn't already been reported.
